## Design

I have made the design for the app in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/VcF0Qi5NV1HEN2nMIJ5GMY/ClimbTracker?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=T8mdP3tb05SEOMdP-1) following design principles I learned during my UI/UX course.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
